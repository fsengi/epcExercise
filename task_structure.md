# What am I trying to do ?

Write two machine learning examples, similar to the one (LeNet), already shown in the exercises. We can also take LeNet as one exampe but we need to take another one as well. \
Options:\
- Multi-layer-perceptron
- ResNet
- VGG


Framework: Tensorflow, LeNet is already in Tensorflow, although terribly slow, and the custom operator api is a little more approachable.
